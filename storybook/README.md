# Storybook & React

Building complex applications can sometimes require
you to break down the various pages/components into simpler
components; in a bid to:
1. Test easily
2. Modify and maintain easily.
3. Style easily
4. Focus on a single element at a time.


In comes `storybook`; storybook allows you to build, debug and document your components 
individually; with amazing UI to test out your components.
